    "Around 1700, Jacob Bernoulli wrote about removing colored balls from an urn in his landmark treatise *[Ars Conjectandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Conjectandi)*, and ever since then, explanations of probability have relied on [urn problems](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=probability%20ball%20urn). (You'd think the urns would be empty by now.) \n",

    "For example, here is a three-part problem [adapted](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/69151.html)  from mathforum.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 23 balls: 8 white, 6 blue, and 9 red.  We select six balls at random (each possible selection is equally likely). What is the probability of each of these possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. all balls are red\n",
    "2. 3 are blue, 2 are white, and 1 is red\n",
    "3. exactly 4 balls are white\n",
    "\n",
    "So, an outcome is a set of 6 balls, and the sample space is the set of all possible 6 ball combinations. We'll solve each of the 3 parts using our `P` function, and also using basic arithmetic; that is, *counting*. Counting is a bit tricky because:\n",
    "- We have multiple balls of the same color. \n",
    "- An outcome is a *set* of balls, where order doesn't matter, not a *sequence*, where order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the first issue, I'll have 8 different white balls labelled `'W1'` through `'W8'`, rather than having eight balls all labelled `'W'`.  That makes it clear that selecting `'W1'` is different from selecting `'W2'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second issue is handled automatically by the `P` function, but if I want to do calculations by hand, I will sometimes first count the number of *permutations* of balls, then get the number of *combinations* by dividing the number of permutations by *c*!, where *c* is the number of balls in a combination. For example, if I want to choose 2 white balls from the 8 available, there are 8 ways to choose a first white ball and 7 ways to choose a second, and therefore 8 &times; 7 = 56 permutations of two white balls. But there are only 56 / 2 = 28 combinations, because `(W1, W2)` is the same combination as `(W2, W1)`.\n",

    ">As to the problem of how to divide the 100 Francs, I think I have found a solution that you will find to be fair. Seeing as I needed only two points to win the game, and you needed 3, I think we can establish that after four more tosses of the coin, the game would have been over. For, in those four tosses, if you did not get the necessary 3 points for your victory, this would imply that I had in fact gained the necessary 2 points for my victory. In a similar manner, if I had not achieved the necessary 2 points for my victory, this would imply that you had in fact achieved at least 3 points and had therefore won the game. Thus, I believe the following list of possible endings to the game is exhaustive. I have denoted 'heads' by an 'h', and tails by a 't.' I have starred the outcomes that indicate a win for myself.\n",

To answer this we need to take into account die rolls, chance and community chest cards, and going to jail (from the \"go to jail\" space, from a card, or from rolling doubles three times in a row). We do not need to take into account anything about buying or selling properties or exchanging money or winning or losing the game, because these don't change a player's location. We will assume that a player in jail will always pay to get out of jail immediately. \n",

    "# The Central Limit Theorem / Strength in Numbers Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have talked of an *outcome* as being a single state of the world. But it can be useful to break that state of the world down into components. We call these components **random variables**. For example, when we consider an experiment in which we roll two dice and observe their sum, we could model the situation with two random variables, one for each die. (Our representation of outcomes has been doing that implicitly all along, when we concatenate two parts of a string, but the concept of a random variable makes it official.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem** states that if you have a collection of random variables and sum them up, then the larger the collection, the closer the sum will be to a *normal distribution* (also called a *Gaussian distribution* or a *bell-shaped curve*). The theorem applies in all but a few pathological cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's take 5 random variables reprsenting the per-game scores of 5 basketball players, and then sum them together to form the team score. Each random variable/player is represented as a function; calling the function returns a single sample from the distribution:\n"

    "\n",
    "But I was asked about *continuous* sample spaces, such as the space of real numbers. The principles are the same: probability is still the ratio of the favorable cases to all the cases, but now instead of *counting* cases, we have to (in general) compute integrals to compare the sizes of cases. \n",

    "\n",
    ">Two players go on a hot new game show called *Higher Number Wins.* The two go into separate booths, and each presses a button, and a random number between zero and one appears on a screen. (At this point, neither knows the other’s number, but they do know the numbers are chosen from a standard uniform distribution.) They can choose to keep that first number, or to press the button again to discard the first number and get a second random number, which they must keep. Then, they come out of their booths and see the final number for each player on the wall. The lavish grand prize — a case full of gold bullion — is awarded to the player who kept the higher number. Which number is the optimal cutoff for players to discard their first number and choose another? Put another way, within which range should they choose to keep the first number, and within which range should they reject it and try their luck with a second number?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this notation:\n",
    "- **A**, **B**: the two players.\n",
    "- *A*, *B*: the cutoff values they choose: the lower bound of the range of first numbers they will accept.\n",
    "- *a*, *b*: the actual random numbers that appear on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if player **A** chooses a cutoff of *A* = 0.6, that means that **A** would accept any first number greater than 0.6, and reject any number below that cutoff. The question is: What cutoff, *A*, should player **A** choose to maximize the chance of winning, that is, maximize P(*a* > *b*)?\n",

What is the probability that **A** gets the higher number? We'll call this `Phigher(A, B)`. We can think of this as a two-dimensional sample space of points in the (*a*, *b*) plane, where *a* ranges from the cutoff *A* to 1 and *b* ranges from the cutoff B to 1. Here is a diagram of that two-dimensional sample space, with the cutoffs *A*=0.5 and *B*=0.6:\n",
